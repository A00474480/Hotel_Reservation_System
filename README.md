# Hotel Reservation System

This Android application serves as a simple hotel reservation system, allowing users to search for hotels based on their check-in and check-out dates, the number of guests, and enter their name for the reservation.

## Features

- **Hotel Search**: Users can input their check-in date, check-out date, the number of guests, and their name to search for available hotels.
- **Input Validation**: The app includes robust input validation, ensuring dates are in the future, the check-out date is after the check-in date, the number of guests is a positive number, and the name contains only alphabets and is under 50 characters.
- **Hotel Listings**: Post-search, the app displays a list of available hotels with details such as name, price, and availability.
